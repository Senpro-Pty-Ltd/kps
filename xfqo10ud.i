/*******************************************************************************
 *
 *  Code may be added here to extend the standard output record or
 *  create additional records.
 *
 *  To extend the standard record:
 *
 *  Fields should be output starting at a position beyond the end
 *  of the existing standard record.
 *  Attempts to put data at positions less than this will result in a
 *  new record being generated as Progress will not over-write existing
 *  data (even if that position contains nulls).
 *
 *  Output should be in the form:-
 *      put
 *         <field>  at <pos>    format <format>
 *         <field>  at <pos>    format <format>
 *         .
 *
 *      where 'field'  = field name, variable, constant, expression
 *            'pos'    = position within the record
 *            'format' = Progress format mask.
 *
 *  Notes:
 *      Do not add a 'skip' to the put statement as the main program
 *      will do this on return.
 *
 *      Be explicit with position and format.  Do not let these
 *      default as dictionary changes in later releases may cause
 *      data alignment problems.
 *
 *
 *  
 *  To create new records:
 *
 *  Issuing a 'put skip.' statement will close the existing record.
 *
 *  A new record can then be created using the logic above for extending
 *  an existing record with the starting position set to '1' and
 *  incrementing from there.
 *
 *  Heed the notes above and do not put a 'skip' on the last record
 *  created as the main program will do this.
 *
 *
 *  Standards:
 *
 *  To achieve consistency with standard output formats, you should
 *  ensure that your code conforms to the conventions illustrated in
 *  the sample code below.  Note the format for dates 'yyyymmdd',
 *  quantities, prices etc and the convention of commenting each line
 *  so that subsequent maintenance is made easier.
 *
 *
 *             /* line detail records */
 *       put
 *      "B"         at 1    format "x"  /* type "B"   */
 *      sod_line        at 2    format ">>9"    /* line number*/
